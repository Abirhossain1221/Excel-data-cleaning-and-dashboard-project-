# Excel data cleaning & dashboard project
## Project Details 
A CSV file containing 1,000 rows of uncleaned freelancer profile data.
It includes inconsistencies in formatting, missing values, and mixed data types making it well suited for data wrangling practice.
I have cleaned the data using Excel and created an interactive dashboard. 

## Dataset Used
- <a https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urvishahir/global-freelancers-raw-dataset
-Each entry includes demographic, professional, and platform-related information such as:
-Name, gender, age, and country
-Primary skill and years of experience
-Hourly rate (with mixed formatting), client rating, and satisfaction score
-Language spoken (based on country)
-Inconsistent and unclean values across several fields (e.g., gender, is_active, satisfaction)
