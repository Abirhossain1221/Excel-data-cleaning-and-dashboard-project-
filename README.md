# Excel data cleaning & dashboard project
## project details 
A CSV file containing 1,000 rows of uncleaned freelancer profile data.
It includes inconsistencies in formatting, missing values, and mixed data types making it well suited for data wrangling practice.
I have cleaned the data using Excel and created an interactive dashboard. 
## dataset used

Each entry includes demographic, professional, and platform-related information such as:
Name, gender, age, and country
Primary skill and years of experience
Hourly rate (with mixed formatting), client rating, and satisfaction score
Language spoken (based on country)
Inconsistent and unclean values across several fields (e.g., gender, is_active, satisfaction)
